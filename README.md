# Pytorch Project Template <!-- omit in toc -->

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

This repository is based on [drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

Difference with the original repository

- add [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf), python formatter, into project structure
- add pre-commit for git hook
- change folders name that all folder names are unique within the project
- Pytorch wrapper pipeline and mlflow
